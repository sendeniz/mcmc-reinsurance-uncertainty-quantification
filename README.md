# mcmc-simulation-uncertainty-quantification
This repo contains the end term project report and code for the Advanced Statistical Computing Course at Leiden University in the academic year 2020-2021. We employ data from an insurance company AVN, which includes client ID, policy PLI incurred loss and policy WC incurred loss. To determine whether a reinsurance policy can help AVN hedge loss and risk, uncertainty is quantified. The report includes a detailed explanation of the problem questions. As data is correlated, we implemented a 1) joe copula model to decompose the joint density into univariates and a copula for depedency structre, 2) use MLE to determine parameters, 3) quantify expected payout and uncertainty using a) MCMC simulation, b) Importance sampling and c) 80 % MCMC generated CI.
